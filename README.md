## About

This project is an external utility for a popular survival game I been working on several weeks ago.

Demonstrates how to create transparent overlay window using [SharpDX](https://github.com/sharpdx/SharpDX)

*Disclaimer:* MemoryFramework library has been excluded on purpose, as it exposes the communication between C# application and the kernel driver.
